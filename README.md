# Content Grabber

Content Grabber is a lightweight PowerShell script that interactively aggregates text from files into one output file.

## Features

- **Automated Aggregation:**  
  Collects content from text-based files and compiles them into `File contents.txt`.

  Skips image files, the script itself, and the output file to ensure only relevant content is included.  

## Requirements

- PowerShell 3.0 or later.  

## Usage

1. Place `ContentGrabber.ps1` in the directory containing the files you want to process.  
2. Open PowerShell in that directory.  
3. Run the script by typing:  

   ```powershell
   .\ContentGrabber.ps1
Review the displayed list of files and press Enter to begin processing.
4. Review the displayed list of files and press Enter to begin processing.
